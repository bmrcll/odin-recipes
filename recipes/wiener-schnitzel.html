    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This wiener schnitzel is an easy German recipe and one of our favorites. Boneless pork chops can also be
        substituted for veal and taste excellent!</p>
    <p>This authentic wiener schnitzel recipe is wonderfully flavorful and irresistibly crispy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Veal: This recipe starts with 1 ½ pounds of veal cutlets.</li>
        <li>Flour and eggs: Dredging the veal in all-purpose flour and eggs ensures a perfectly crispy finished product.
        </li>
        <li>Cheese and milk: Add Parmesan cheese and milk to the egg mixture to add flavor and help lock in moisture.
        </li>
        <li>Seasonings: Season the wiener schnitzel with minced parsley, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs: Use store-bought dry bread crumbs or make your own at home.</li>
        <li>Butter: Cook the breaded veal cutlets in butter on the stove.</li>
        <li>Lemon: Garnish the wiener schnitzel with lemon slices.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Mix the eggs, cheese, milk, and seasonings in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip the cutlets in the egg mixture, then coat with bread crumbs.</li>
