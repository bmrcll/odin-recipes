# odin-recipes

This is my first project in The Odin Project Foundations course. The objective is to build a basic recipe website.
In this project, I aim to demonstrate the following:
- Understanding of basic syntax and structure of HTML
- Proper application of tags such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Version control using Git practice

This project is a stepping stone towards developing more advanced websites and will serve as a foundation for learning CSS and JavaScript in the future.
